## Description :page_facing_up:

**YouConnect** is a React Native application that allows users to manage their contacts and groups in an efficient and user-friendly way. With YouConnect, you can register and log in, edit your user profile, and even delete your account if necessary.

## Features :star2:

- **User Management (User CRUD)**: Register and log in, edit your user profile, and even delete your account if necessary.
- **Contact Management (Contact CRUD)**: Add multiple contacts with their respective names, surnames, numbers, and any other information you consider relevant. You can also view, edit, and delete your contacts.
- **Alphabetical Order**: Contacts are presented in alphabetical order for easy searching.
- **User Verification**: It is verified that the same user with the same name and number is not added.
- **Group Management (Group CRUD)**: You can create "Groups" to which contacts will be associated. You can also view, edit, and delete groups. In case of deleting a group, the user is informed that the contacts will be deleted, but if a contact is deleted from a group, it simply falls out of the group.
- **Multiparty to groups**: A contact can be in multiple "Groups".
